<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My Chinese name is 郑奇志.

I am currently a PhD candidate majoring in [grassland science](https://cgst.cau.edu.cn/) at [Chinese Agriculture University](https://www.cau.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Jie Wang](https://cgst.cau.edu.cn/art/2021/1/20/art_49926_975651.html). Before that, I got my Master Degree at [Northeast Forestry University](https://www.nefu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Guanghui Dong](https://ccec.nefu.edu.cn/info/1043/1938.htm).

My research interests include Grassland Science, Machine Learning, and Biomedical Engineering.

I am still in the initial learning stage of my scientific research and have strong self-motivation. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an [email](curry30258036@gmail.com).
